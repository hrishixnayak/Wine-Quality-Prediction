🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to understand how different chemical attributes influence wine quality and to build a predictive model that can estimate quality scores effectively.

This project is part of my 30 Days of Data Science & Machine Learning Challenge (Day 2).
